# Kukuri Client
A free and open-source Discord selfbot with powerful features.

## What is Kukuri Client?
Kukuri Client is a selfbot I created after noticing that many users purchase selfbots with a lot of useless commands. Kukuri Client is different. It's free, open-source, and focuses on providing only the most useful features you need. Don't worry, Kukuri Client won't betray you!

I've seen that many people want to try selfbots, but unfortunately, many of them have fallen victim to hacking by using free programs. That's why Kukuri Client is here!

## To-Do List
- [ ] Web Control (Next.js): Add the ability to control the selfbot through a web interface built with Next.js (or potentially a UI).
- [ ] Improved Code Readability: Make the code cleaner and easier to understand.
- [ ] More Useful Commands: Continuously add new commands that provide genuine value to users.
- [ ] Example Usage: Provide examples of how to use the bot effectively.

## Getting Started
* Clone the repository.
* Run the following command in your terminal:
```
$ node Setup.js
```
Alternatively: 
```
$ bun run Setup.js
```
The setup process will prompt you with the following questions:
```
[INFO] ❇️ : Setup service Started!
Enable Desktop Notification? (y/n): Choose whether you want desktop notifications for bot activity.
Do you want to set a new prefix? (default is .): This allows you to customize the command prefix (the character used before commands).
Please enter your user token: Enter your Discord user token to authenticate the selfbot. 
```
